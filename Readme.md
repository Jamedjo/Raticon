* The app will process your collection using the **name of each sub-folder** to lookup the imdb id. This means any files relating to a movie must be in a folder named after the movie.
* When all films have loaded click "Make Icons".
* You can 'Watch' a folder to automatically create icons when a new film is added.
* You may need to clear your thumbnail cache and restart explorer for the icons to update.

### Film Search

* If the film has an ambiguous title you will be asked to pick the correct film.
* If the sub-folder already contains a `_imdb_.nfo` file it will use the id from that file.
