This means any files relating to a movie must be in a folder named after the movie.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n### Add Folder\r\n\r\n![Raticon App](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1028741/4921034/28f90770-6507-11e4-95d5-eacf8739e808.png)\r\n\r\n* Click \"Select Folder\" and select your movie folder.\r\n* When all films have loaded click \"Make Icons\".\r\n* You can 'Watch' a folder to automatically create icons when a new film is added.\r\n* You may need to clear your thumbnail cache and restart explorer for the icons to update.\r\n\r\n### Film Search\r\n\r\n* If the film has an ambiguous title you will be asked to pick the correct film.\r\n* If the sub-folder already contains a `_imdb_.nfo` file it will use the id from that file.\r\n\r\n![Result Picker](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1028741/3213279/4801a01e-ef87-11e3-83c9-cb14500f8b53.png)\r\n\r\n### Cache Location\r\n\r\n* If the wrong film has been selected you can remove the `_imdb_.nfo` file in the film's folder. You will also need to delete the `folder.ico` and `folder.jpg` images if you want them to be updated.\r\n* Raticon caches film information in the `ProgramData` folder. E.g. `C:\\ProgramData\\Raticon\\Cache`. If a rating is wrong/out-of-date you can force an update by deleting both the icon and the cache.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
