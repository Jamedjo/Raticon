### Todo

* `Make icons` should be disabled until load complete.
* Get ratings in background thread
* Enable "Make Icons" button only when ratings complete and update status bar.

### Ideas

* Ignore/demote lookup results which don't have type film (eg tv or game) and which don't have rating. Maybe sort by number of votes cast. Promote films with matching year.
* Store folders in settings
* More than one folder at once
* Tickboxes and option to build the following
  * hasFolder.jpg
  * has.rating
  * has_imdb_.nfo
* Retry imdb id lookup with new search shouldn't go to end of queue
* Icons should build in background maybe
