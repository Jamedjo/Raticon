### Todo

* Should be able to cancel "Make Icons"
* Get `folder.jpg`s in background instead of during icon creation

### Ideas

* Store folders in settings
* More than one folder at once
* Tickboxes and option to build the following
  * hasFolder.jpg
  * has.rating
  * has_imdb_.nfo
* Retry imdb id lookup with new search shouldn't go to end of queue
* Last ListView column should stretch on resize
* Progress complete dialog could have button to launch folder.
* Status bar to show how many ratings/imdbIds/folder.jpgs are being fetched.
