### Todo

* `Make icons` should be disabled until load complete.
* Get ratings in background thread
* Enable "Make Icons" button only when ratings complete and update status bar.
* Progressbar on "Make Icons"

### Ideas

* Store folders in settings
* More than one folder at once
* Tickboxes and option to build the following
  * hasFolder.jpg
  * has.rating
  * has_imdb_.nfo
* Retry imdb id lookup with new search shouldn't go to end of queue
* Icons should build in background maybe
* Last ListView column should stretch on resize
